## Arbitory
   A game that is currently in development. The idea is to have an open world fps based around automation and capturing/defending areas of resource production. If you can 3d model, think up game design, or code, feel free to ask (@Squid)[https://github.com/ShrimpToes] or (@Eldeston)[https://github.com/Eldeston] what you can do.
